    "teaching": {
      "question": "Do you teach English?",
      "answer": "No, we don't teach English. We are a verification platform, not a teaching platform. Children learn elsewhere (school, cram school), we verify if they recognize foundation elements."
    },
    "different": {
      "question": "How are you different from teaching apps?",
      "answer": "Teaching apps teach, we verify results. We provide objective third-party verification, verifying if your education investment actually worked."
    },
    "verify": {
      "question": "What do you verify?",
      "answer": "We verify if children recognize foundation elements (words, phrases, idioms). We verify recognition ability, not deep understanding (that's our future goal). Recognition is the foundation of understanding."
    },
    "scholarship": {
      "question": "How does the verification scholarship work?",
      "answer": "Parents deposit NT$500-1,000 as verification scholarship deposit. After children pass verification tests, scholarship unlocks. Parents can withdraw anytime. Meet verification standards, 100% refund."
    },
    "scam": {
      "question": "Isn't this a scam?",
      "answer": "No. We are an educational verification platform, not a cash flow verification platform. Your money is in platform escrow account, unlocks after child verification. Business model is completely transparent, withdrawable anytime."
    },
    "withdraw": {
      "question": "Can money really be withdrawn anytime?",
      "answer": "Yes. Zero handling fees, arrives within 1 day after linking bank account. This is your money, not ours. You have full control."
    },
    "methodology": {
      "question": "Why is your verification method better?",
      "answer": "We use Knowledge Graph structure (relationship-based), not alphabetical order. Spaced repetition verification (Day 3, 7, 14) ensures long-term recognition, not short-term memory. 99.54% confidence, not 25% guessing rate."
    },
    "gap": {
      "question": "Why stay ahead of official numbers?",
      "answer": "Official numbers say senior high needs 4,000-5,000 words, but reality expects 8,000+. Meeting only official numbers = actually behind. We help you verify if your child is truly ahead, ready to face real expectations."
