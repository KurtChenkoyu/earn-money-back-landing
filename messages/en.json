    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about LexiCraft • 字塊所",
    "teaching": {
      "question": "Do you teach English?",
      "answer": "No, we don't teach English. We are a verification platform, not a teaching platform. Children learn elsewhere (school, cram school), we verify if they recognize foundation elements."
    },
    "different": {
      "question": "How are you different from teaching apps?",
      "answer": "Teaching apps teach, we verify results. We provide objective third-party verification, verifying if your education investment actually worked."
    },
    "verify": {
      "question": "What do you verify?",
      "answer": "We verify if children recognize foundation elements (words, phrases, idioms). We verify recognition ability, not deep understanding (that's our future goal). Recognition is the foundation of understanding."
    },
    "scholarship": {
      "question": "How does the Block Trust work?",
      "answer": "Parents purchase a Block Trust Package (NT$500-1,000). Money stays in escrow, locked in blocks. Kids unlock blocks through validation quizzes. Once unlocked, funds are released to the child's account. Parents can withdraw anytime. Meet validation standards, 100% of trust funds unlocked."
    },
    "mining": {
      "question": "What is Brain Mining?",
      "answer": "Brain Mining is our gamified validation system. Kids see locked blocks (gray), each with a value. They use validation quizzes (the pickaxe) to unlock blocks. Correct answers = critical hits. Unlocked blocks turn gold and cash is deposited. It's not forced study, it's legal mining."
    },
    "trust": {
      "question": "How is this different from regular tuition?",
      "answer": "Regular tuition: You pay, money is gone, hope they learned. Block Trust: You invest, money stays in escrow, they unlock it through proof of learning. It transforms education spending from consumption into asset transfer. Your money isn't spent until they prove recognition."
    },
    "scam": {
      "question": "Isn't this a scam?",
      "answer": "No. We are an educational verification platform, not a cash flow verification platform. Your money is in platform escrow account, unlocks after child verification. Business model is completely transparent, withdrawable anytime."
    },
    "withdraw": {
      "question": "Can money really be withdrawn anytime?",
      "answer": "Yes. Zero handling fees, arrives within 1 day after linking bank account. This is your money, not ours. You have full control."
    },
    "methodology": {
      "question": "Why is your verification method better?",
      "answer": "We use Knowledge Graph structure (relationship-based), not alphabetical order. Spaced repetition verification (Day 3, 7, 14) ensures long-term recognition, not short-term memory. 99.54% confidence, not 25% guessing rate."
    },
    "gap": {
      "question": "Why stay ahead of official numbers?",
      "answer": "Official numbers say senior high needs 4,000-5,000 words, but reality expects 8,000+. Meeting only official numbers = actually behind. We help you verify if your child is truly ahead, ready to face real expectations."
