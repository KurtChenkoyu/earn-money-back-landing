### 2. Test Analytics

1. Visit your live site
2. Navigate through different sections
3. Click CTAs and submit the form
4. Check your analytics dashboard:
   - **PostHog**: Events → Live events
   - **Mixpanel**: Events → Live view
5. Verify events are tracking:
   - Page views
   - Form submissions
   - CTA clicks

### 3. Test Mobile Responsiveness

1. Use browser dev tools (F12 → Device toolbar)

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Submitting

**Issue**: Form shows error or doesn't submit

**Solutions**:
1. Check environment variables are set correctly in Vercel/Netlify
2. Verify API keys are valid
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify email service API is accessible (not blocked by firewall)

### Analytics Not Tracking

**Issue**: Events not appearing in analytics dashboard

**Solutions**:
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify API keys are valid
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure ad blockers are disabled (they can block analytics)
5. Wait a few minutes for events to appear (some services have delay)

### Build Fails

**Issue**: Deployment fails during build

**Solutions**:
1. Check build logs in Vercel/Netlify dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Ensure Node.js version is compatible (Vercel uses 18.x by default)
4. Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build` locally

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Page Views**: Total visitors
2. **Form Submissions**: Waitlist signups
3. **Conversion Rate**: Form submissions / Page views
4. **Bounce Rate**: Single-page visits
5. **Time on Page**: Engagement metric

### Weekly Review

- Check email service for new subscribers
- Review analytics for traffic patterns
- Monitor form submission rate
- Check for any errors in logs
